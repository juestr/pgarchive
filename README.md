# pgarchive

A PostgreSQL Archive Server providing fast and incremental Backup and Restore Services

## Release Status

This is a early alpha software. You will need to change parameters and possibly code in a shell script to make this work for you.

Release 4.x supports PostgreSQL 9.4 and 9.5.

It is used in production at [emarsys.com] to back up large (up to 1TB sizec, 100GB WAL per day) databases and you may find it useful or at least inspirational.

## Features and Design Goals

* pgarchive runs an archive container service using local storage
    * more than just a one-shot backup and restore tool
    * can backup local and remote databases
    * works for whole DB clusters (like [pg_basebackup], not like pg_dump)
    * incremental data storage
    * can run containers for multiple database servers on a single host
    * a database server can be backed up to multiple pgarchive containers (e.g. at different sites)
    * can backup a hot standby server
    * CLI interface to create and manage containers, and assist in recovery
* avoinding complexity and reinventing the wheel
    * it's a single shell script without fancy dependencies
    * most work is accomplished using the built-in PostgreSQL applications, sometimes in novel ways
    * uses [btrfs] to store only the incremental difference between snapshots of a database cluster directory
    * uses cron for time based jobs
* user friendliness
    * it is intended to be usable by people who are not PostgreSQL experts for routine tasks
    * one command initialization and teardown of whole backup containers
    * supports restore with point in time recovery
    * includes maintenance tasks for time based expiry, compression, etc. via cron
    * keeps helpful logs
    * has a simple dashboard
    * custom bash completion
* little impact on upstream database, continuous operation
    * after initial setup containers pull down data using only streaming replication
    * no load spikes or delays due to full dumps, [pg_basebackup]s or rsyncs
    * does not require instrumentation of upstream DB except for a replication slot, which it creates and removes itself
    * the upstream DB does not need to (and should not!) run on btrfs
* fast (local) restore
    * as fast as activating a btrfs snapshot and doing postgres recovery to consistency
    * allow point in time recovery forward from any snapshot
    * full disaster recovery is currently not supported, but easy to do and add in the future (rsync or [pg_basebackup] a local copy somewhere else)
* resilience
    * to outages of the upstream DB
    * network interruptions
    * continues where it stopped if interrupted
    * it is easy to monitor


## Caveats

* opinionated
    * uses standard tools in a unique way
    * presumes some upstream configuration parameters, like CSV logging, and an available streaming replication connection and slot
    * at the moment contains many hard coded configuration parameters in the script instead of in a configuration file
* requires PostgreSQL 9.4+
    * due to its architecture and use of [replication slots] earlier versions cannot be supported
    * does not support cross-version backup&restore, containers must match upstream databases exactly
* requires [btrfs] for containers, despite well known problems with PostgreSQL
    * locally restored and started database clusters run on btrfs, and will be slow
    * btrfs fragmentation issues cause even more performance loss over time, needs frequent defragmentation
    * deemed acceptable for an archive system, as the throughput is good enough and snapshots are a huge benefit
* use at your own risk!
